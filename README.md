## PDF file into spreadsheet
================================

 1. [Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/DigitalBook/I/Inventory%20of%20Sanskrit%20Scholars.pdf)
    contains a list of the Sanskrit scholars across Bharat along with their details.
    
 2. Converting the PDF file into spreadsheet format facilitates
    quick searching and sorting.
 
 3. This project is undertaken to accomplish this task.
 
 4. Currently the names along with details have been extracted from the file.
    Pending task is to separate the various fields like DOB, address etc. from 
    every entry.
    
 5. Any interested person can contribute to this project.
    The `output_entries` file needs to be separated into fields.
